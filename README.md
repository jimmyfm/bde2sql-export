# BDE 2 SQL Export

Once upon a time, in a world of thick clients and client applications, [BDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Database_Engine) was a great and powerful tool allowing to simply and visually build an application.

That time has passed.

Now BDE is a vestigial of that glorious past and a limitation to grow an application past 32bits and locally shared databases.

There was a request to recompile a Delphi7 application in order to run on Win10 and that's how this journey started. A newever Delphi was needed to build that code and in newer version there is no support for BDE.

That's how the BDE escape plan started.
